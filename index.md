Welcome to the abductedPlatypus website. Here I post my projects and explanations on why and how I made them, and post about my insights in game and interaction design and related topics.

Follow me on [Twitter][twitter] or [Twitch][twitch], if you like to be kept updated because I will talk about my new stuff there first.
