I am a game designer from the Netherlands, in addition I stream development on Twitch. I aim to release most of the stuff I make on GitHub, as long as it is financially viable for me. If I find the time I will write papers to accompany the stuff I make and to explain the stuff I do more formally.  

Since my 12th I made custom maps and assets for games like Age of Empirtes/Mythology, Portal 2 and Team Fortress 2, some of which were made 'official', later during university I learned programming and made successful games in several Ludum Dare. and was lucky enough to have some of my interactive installations on display only meters from know modern artist like Banksy and  Damien Hirst. 

I call these personal successes, which is defined as `timeEnjoyedByOthers - timeBuildByMe > 0`

I also ran two companies, I did some design and implementation freelance work for several international and multinationals, and travel through Europe. Both of which I think were both personal and financial successful.

Right now I am looking for creative opportunities and doing things purely for fun, while wrapping up my studies.
